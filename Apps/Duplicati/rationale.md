## Root Access
Root access is required to function properly as a backup solution. Duplicati needs to access system files, user directories, and preserve file permissions across the entire filesystem during backup and restore operations. Using PUID/PGID would prevent access to system directories and break the ability to maintain proper file ownership during restores.
