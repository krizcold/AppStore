# Immich Rationale

## Authentication

Authentication is directly managed by Immich itself. The application provides its own built-in user management system with secure login functionality, including:

- User registration and login system
- Password-based authentication
- Multi-user support with individual libraries
- Admin panel for user management

No additional authentication layer is required as Immich handles all security aspects internally through its web interface.
